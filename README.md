# PakageDelivery
This project is just prototype for demonstration idea only and not full function as describe

## Description
In one working day, there's a lot of orders.
Each order is a job contain 2 tasks : **Pick up** and **Delivery**.
All system job would be in 1 queue, and operator/system could randomly assign job to drivers
So when driver was assigned a job, it will be split in 2 task => 2 task need to be complete to finish a single order
At the same time, driver could process many orders
=> application must arrange routes between many tasks logically to optimize perfomance for driver

At one point of time, when having task processing, application show maps and direction from current position to task's destination 
=> when driver finish current task, map continuously updated route to next task

=> when new job is assigned , there's a notification to notify driver new task
=> driver could observer the job list of system update in realtime and could pick job by themselves

## Data generate
All data is generated by google api
From a position, randomly getting 20 address near by with radius 4km
=> with 20 address, randomly generate 20 jobs with a pair of tasks **Pick up** and **Delivery**
=> processing 2 jobs, push 4 task in assignment
=> fetching direction from current position to current task destination
